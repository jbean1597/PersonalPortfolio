# Year In Code
On the journey to a career in data analytics, it's clear that the most wanted quality that companies are looking for is experience. Projects are the best way to gain/show that experience and what better way to do that other than committing to working on an analysis or visualization project every day for a whole year?

### Data Sources
The data will be collected from a variety of sources - web scraped data, Kaggle, Google Datasets, etc. All sources will be linked and credited within the README of each project.

## The Goals
* Improve all aspects of the data analysis process and skillset
  - Collection
  - Cleaning
  - Processing
  - Analysis
  - Visualization
  - Dahsboards
* Document my learning journey for myself to look back on and future aspiring analysts to see what a real journey looks like day-to-day

## The Projects
The structure of the projects will be one week long (52 projects by the end) and each day will be a different aspect of the data analysis process. I will follow the Google Data Analytics framework of **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act** with each step being a certain day's contribution to this project - i.e. Day 1 will be the Ask phase, Day 2 the Prepare phase, etc.
