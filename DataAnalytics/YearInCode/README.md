# Year In Code
On the journey to a career in data analytics, it's clear that the most wanted quality that companies are looking for is experience. Projects are the best way and what better way to do that other than committing to working on an analysis or visualization project every day for a whole year?

## The Goals
* Improve all aspects of the data analysis process and skillset
  - Collection
  - Cleaning
  - Processing
  - Analysis
  - Visualization
  - Dahsboards
* Document my learning journey for myself to look back on and future aspiring analysts to see what a real journey looks like day-to-day

## The Projects
The structure of the projects will be one week long (52 projects by the end) and each day will be a different aspect of the data analysis process. I will follow the Google Data Analytics framework of **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act** with each step being a certain day's contribution to this project - i.e. Day 1 will be the Ask phase, Day 2 the Prepare phase, etc.

### The Data
The data will be collected from a variety of sources - web scraped data, Kaggle, Google Datasets, etc.
