## The Problem
While there is not a "problem" per se to be solved with this week's dataset, that doesn't mean interesting insights and visualizations can't be drawn from it. I have a deep interest in languages, whether that be learning them or being amazed at the variety between languages while still sharing so many similarities, so a dataset that allows me to combine both passions of mine would be a great choice for me!  

## Day 1: Ask
* Does proximity influence languages spoken in that region? (i.e. are borders a discerning factor in defining the languages spoken?)
* Do languages that are geographically close share more similarities?
* How do languages migrate and spread?
* What languages are the most common and also which are the most widespread? Which are the most localized/most resistant to globalization?
* **Hypotheses:** Proximity and similarities will share a strong relationship, perhaps the strongest determining factor. English will be the most widespread language while Mandarin will be one of the least widespread languages, possibly behind some much less common languages

## Day 2: Prepare
