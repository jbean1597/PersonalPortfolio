# Scripts
## About
This folder contains all of the scripts I have created including a webscraper, etc, and etc. Feel free to use the code implemented in any of these projects to test it out and see the performance for yourself.

2. [Web Scraper](https://github.com/jbean1597/PersonalPortfolio/tree/main/Scripts/Webscraper)

## Project 1: Web Scraper
* This project scrapes Indeed job postings to gather data that is then analyzed
* First phase is data collection: Geology careers and Data Analysis careers
* Once collected, analysis will begin by examining the different amount of years and experience required for entry-level positions
* Other relationships will be examined such as experience required and salary expected, location and salary, and remote and salary/expectations
* Hypothesis to be tested: Entry-level geology jobs are not actually entry-level and require years of experience before you can break into the field

## Project 2: Trading Bot
* This project is an ongoing work and will be updated as such
* First phase of establishing API connections to a trading account and performing simple trades with multiple deciding factors for limit orders was successful
* The next portion I will be working on is improving the trading strategy and automating the process to run throughout the day
* The final step will be implementing the bot in my own trading account and letting it handle my money to see how it performs
