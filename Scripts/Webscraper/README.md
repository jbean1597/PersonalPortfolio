## Introduction
This webscraper is a complementary program I created to test a hypothesis I had about the post-pandemic job market for entry-level geology careers. I collected the titles, companies, locations, job descriptions, and salaries for hundreds of jobs on Indeed to analyze.

*Hypothesis to be Tested:* Entry-level careers in geology require years of experience and largely aren't suited fr early career professional, even if they have a degree in the field.

## Code
Selenium libraries were used in implementing this webscraper due to their ease of use and abundance of documentation present online allowing quick learning. Selenium also handles JavaScript exceptionally well, something necessary for Indeed due to the job card system.
